# claude-minecraft-use

This repo uses Claude computer use [quick starts](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts) as base templates with modifications:
- Direct control of local MacOS (requires some changes of tools for actions)
- Allows AI to control Minecraft

This repo is just for fun and testing the capabilities of Claude computer use. Thanks to the great work of the Claude team for making this possible. Also thanks to [BlueM](https://github.com/BlueM) for cliclick which makes this demo work on Mac.

Limitations discovered during testing:
1. Coordinate control is not accurate enough
2. Cannot handle complex tasks step by step unless prompted well
